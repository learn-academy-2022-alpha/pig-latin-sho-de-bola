/**
ACTION ITEM: when you are ready for your full user experience, delete the test words so phrase is assigned an empty string

ACTION ITEM: use "currentWord" as a starting point for your code

ACTION ITEM: change the value of currentWord to the name of whatever variable you made containing your Pig Latin'd word

ACTION ITEM: when you are ready for your full user experience, delete the test words in phrase so that is assigned an empty string




 -Fix input area to return blank string when refreshed or cleared
 -Read through all pseudo code
 -identify all action items
 -identify desired output

 ----> users input is split into an array of strings
 ----> .map to iterate over each element (currentWord)
 ----> currentWord split in individual letters
 ----> vowels filtered out and stored into an array (vowelsArray)




 ----> OUR LOGIC


 ----> changed/translated words added to translatedWords array and outputted

 -chose a word for each pig latin rule to be used in a sentence
 -isolate rules individually
 -create a variable for each rule
 -create conditional if/else if statments to check each mapped word (currentWord) against rule condition
 -automatically added back to
 -return correct translation
 -test with random parameters

 -stretch challenges to incorporate punctuation and casing
